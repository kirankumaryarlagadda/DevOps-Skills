In order to create an Image using Alpine Lnux and running script: 

- make sure you have docker installed on system and you have docker hub login which is used to host container images.
- copy the Dockerfile and swapy.py script file to local system.
- run the following commands
	- docker build -t swapi . (which will create docker image)
	- docker images (which list docker images)
	- docker run -it --rm swapi (which start docker container and execute script)
	- docker tag <Image ID> yourdockerhubid/yourdockerhubrepo:containerTag (assign tag to the container)
	- docker push yourdockerhubid/yourdockerhubrepo


I have performed all the above steps and created a container where you can pull and execute from my docker hub
	- make sure you have docker installed on system and running.
	- docker pull kirankumaryarlagadda/swapi
	- docker run -it --rm kirankumaryarlagadda/swapi (it will start executing script from scenario1 and provide results based on user choise)
